# Pywumpus

## Introduction 
This is an attempt to implent the Wumpus World game in Python. The game is a simple text-based game where the player has to navigate through a cave to find the gold and exit the cave without getting killed by the Wumpus or falling into a pit. This is based on the original Wumpus World game developed by Gregory Yob in 1973 [^1].
